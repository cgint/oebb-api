# ÖBB API Direct Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

This project provides a modern JavaScript client for the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) API. It was created to replace the outdated oebb-api npm package that was last updated in 2017 and no longer works correctly with the current ÖBB API.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Modern API Client Implementation**
   - Created a clean implementation using modern ES module syntax
   - Updated to work with the latest ÖBB API endpoints
   - Implemented Promise-based asynchronous API

2. **Core Features**
   - Station search functionality that retrieves accurate station data
   - Live train departure information with real-time updates
   - Train delay checking with detailed status information
   - Support for both scheduled and real-time departure information

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Well-documented API with clear function signatures
   - Comprehensive README with usage examples
   - Command-line demo script for easy testing
   - Detailed object structure documentation

4. **Technical Improvements**
   - Fixed compatibility issues with the HAFAS SCOTTY API
   - Properly handles JSONP response parsing
   - Simplified authentication process
   - Robust error handling

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses a combination of the ÖBB tickets API (for station search) and the HAFAS SCOTTY API (for train departures and delay information). It supports:

- **Station Search**: Uses the `https://tickets.oebb.at/api/hafas/v1/stations` endpoint
- **Train Departures**: Uses the `https://fahrplan.oebb.at/bin/stboard.exe/dn` endpoint
- **Authentication**: Uses the `https://tickets.oebb.at/api/domain/v3/init` endpoint

## Live Data Features

The API retrieves real-time data from the ÖBB network, including:

- Current departures and arrivals at stations
- Real-time delay information
- Platform changes
- Train cancellations

## Usage

The API is easy to use and requires minimal setup:

```javascript
import { searchStations, getTrainDepartures, checkTrainDelay } from './oebb-direct.js';

// Find stations
searchStations('Wien').then(console.log);

// Get departures from a station
getTrainDepartures('1290401').then(console.log);

// Check if a specific train is delayed
checkTrainDelay('1290401', 'RJ 373').then(console.log);
```

The command-line demo script provides a convenient way to test the API:

```bash
node demo.js search Wien
node demo.js departures 1290401
node demo.js delay 1290401 "RJ 373"
```

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a reliable and up-to-date way to access ÖBB train information programmatically. It could be used for building applications that need real-time train data, such as travel planners, delay notification systems, or data analysis tools.
